# WeatherDashboard_project
A Weather Dashboard is a simple web application designed to display weather-related information of a given location. It asks users to input a city name and view details such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. The dashboard provides a clean and interactive interface for easy weather lookup. While some versions use real-time data from APIs, a basic version can simulate weather using pre-defined data for specific cities. This project helps users understand how to work with form inputs, conditional rendering, and dynamic content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
